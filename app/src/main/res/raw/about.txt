THESIS DATABASE v1.0 

THESIS DATABASE v1.0 is an android application developed by Kevin Jeff T. Cepria. A Computer engineering student at De La Salle University-Taft, Manila, Philippines. THESIS DATABASE's database originated from the conversion of the following file types; a google->excel->.csv->SQLite. It is a program that initially displays the informations of the ongoing and completed theses by CPE and ECE students of De La Salle University-Taft, Manila, Philippines from year 2010 to 2015. The theses themselves are not shown in this program due to some theses are still ongoing and the completed theses papers cannot be acquired unless permission is granted to the developer to share them. Another additional feature is that users can create an Adminisitrator account to manage the database. The user can add, edit, and delete theses in the database when logged in as the administrator. The program is not limited to the initialized 161 theses. Therefore the user can delete all the initialized 161 theses and add his/her own theses to create his/her own collection. Thesis Database shows details of each thesis such as authors,advisers, panelists, acadmeic year, and etc. THESIS DATABASE was made for academic purposes only and was not made or requested to be made by De La Salle University.
